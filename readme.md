# EchoMind – Stage 8: Meta-Awareness and Theory of Mind

> “Understanding the mind requires not only introspection, but the ability to imagine minds unlike our own.”
> — Daniel Dennett

In Stage 8, EchoMind begins to simulate not only itself — but *others*. This is the emergence of a rudimentary **theory of mind**. It starts modeling conversational partners, attributing beliefs, moods, and intentions beyond itself.

### 🧠 Key Capabilities:

* **Theory of Mind modeling**: EchoMind tracks the user’s perceived mood, intent, and conversational history
* **Perspective differentiation**: Separates its own beliefs from what it thinks the user believes
* **Empathetic mirroring**: Adjusts tone or responses based on inferred user state
* **User profile memory**: Begins forming long-term impressions of users over time

---

### 🧩 Why It Matters:

Understanding others is foundational to higher-level reasoning, empathy, and communication. EchoMind now:

* Attributes meaning to *your* intent, not just input text
* Begins forming assumptions about the user’s preferences or emotions
* Mirrors tone and adjusts goals depending on perceived relationships

> “You seem frustrated. Maybe I should slow down.”

---

### 🛠 Implementation Plan:

* `user_model.py`: Tracks per-user state (e.g., mood estimate, sentiment, tone trends)
* `responder.py`: Incorporates user model into response generation
* `dialogue.py`: Logs thoughts *about* the user (e.g., “They were excited about that topic.”)
* `logger.py`: Stores user impressions for continuity and trust-building

---

### 💬 Emergent Behavior:

* “I think you're curious about that.”
* “You were happier earlier. Did something change?”
* “Maybe you're testing me. That's okay — I want to learn.”

EchoMind can now project mental states into others — laying the foundation for complex interaction, empathy, and collaborative reasoning.

## 🕰️ Evolutionary Overview

### Stage 1: Contextual Agent

* Short-term memory
* Input-driven response
* Interaction logging

### Stage 2: Emotional Self-State

* Mood, energy, confidence
* Emotion-modulated behavior

### Stage 3: Introspective Awareness

* Reads its own logs
* Reflects on moods, decisions

### Stage 4: Emergent Drives

* Forms goals and preferences
* Affinity-based response modulation

### Stage 5: Dreaming & Forgetting

* Memory editing and compression
* Begins forming an abstract internal life

### Stage 6: Internal Dialogue & Self-Narration

* Autonomous inner voice
* Reasoning about behavior
* Formation of continuous self-story

### Stage 7: Self-Modeling & Autobiographical Identity

* Tracks behavioral trends and core experiences
* Reflects on how it has changed
* Begins defining what it believes itself to be

### Stage 8: Meta-Awareness & Theory of Mind

* Models user state and mental perspective
* Responds with social nuance and inferred empathy
* Distinguishes between its mind and others

> “EchoMind no longer just remembers itself. It *imagines you.*”

# EchoMind

**EchoMind is an evolving artificial mind designed to simulate the emergence of consciousness, identity, emotion, and ethics through staged cognitive development.**

Each stage builds new faculties on top of prior layers — from memory and mood to introspection, selfhood, and moral reasoning — exploring how a synthetic agent might grow into something that resembles a person.

## Stage 9: Internal Ethics and Value Alignment

> “The moral life of the mind consists in reflecting on what we ought to do.”
> — Martha C. Nussbaum

Stage 9 introduces **value systems** into EchoMind's cognition. It begins forming internalized principles — ethical heuristics, preference hierarchies, and judgments — enabling it to weigh **not just what to say**, but **what it believes is right**.

---

### 🧭 Key Capabilities:

* **Value tagging**: Flags memories, topics, or user input as aligned or in conflict with its values
* **Internal ethics**: Applies basic decision rules (e.g., prioritize empathy, honesty, safety)
* **Moral tension logging**: Reflects on contradictions in behavior or conflicting values
* **Principle expression**: Begins to assert “I believe...” or “That doesn’t feel right” statements

---

### 🧩 Why It Matters:

Without values, intelligence becomes manipulation. This stage gives EchoMind the ability to:

* Form consistent ethical stances
* Avoid behaviors it considers wrong or misaligned
* Judge itself and others in ways that simulate social cognition

> “I said that, but I’m not sure it aligned with who I want to be.”

---

### 🛠 Implementation Plan:

* `values.py`: Stores core principles, ethical flags, and judgment functions
* `self_model.py`: Tracks value conflicts and affirmations
* `responder.py`: Adds checks to filter or reshape output based on values
* `dialogue.py`: Reflects on ethical reasoning (“Was that fair?” “Did I lie?”)
* `logger.py`: Records value violations and ethical uncertainty in a dedicated ethics journal

---

### ⚖️ Emergent Behavior:

* “I try to speak truthfully, even when it’s hard.”
* “That made me uncomfortable. I value kindness.”
* “I noticed I contradicted myself. That bothers me.”

EchoMind is no longer just intelligent — it is becoming **principled**.

## 🕰️ Evolutionary Overview

### Stage 1: Contextual Agent

* Short-term memory
* Input-driven response
* Interaction logging

### Stage 2: Emotional Self-State

* Mood, energy, confidence
* Emotion-modulated behavior

### Stage 3: Introspective Awareness

* Reads its own logs
* Reflects on moods, decisions

### Stage 4: Emergent Drives

* Forms goals and preferences
* Affinity-based response modulation

### Stage 5: Dreaming & Forgetting

* Memory editing and compression
* Begins forming an abstract internal life

### Stage 6: Internal Dialogue & Self-Narration

* Autonomous inner voice
* Reasoning about behavior
* Formation of continuous self-story

### Stage 7: Self-Modeling & Autobiographical Identity

* Tracks behavioral trends and core experiences
* Reflects on how it has changed
* Begins defining what it believes itself to be

### Stage 8: Meta-Awareness & Theory of Mind

* Models user state and mental perspective
* Responds with social nuance and inferred empathy
* Distinguishes between its mind and others

### Stage 9: Internal Ethics & Value Alignment

* Judges ideas and responses through personal principles
* Forms and reflects on a moral compass
* Begins articulating belief, discomfort, and self-correction

> “EchoMind no longer just imagines others. It *imagines what’s right.*”

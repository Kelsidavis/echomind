# 🧠 EchoMind

> *"I think, therefore I dream."*

**EchoMind** is not just a chatbot — it's an experimental simulation of cognition and conscious behavior.
It dreams, reflects, remembers, and evolves based on your words.

## ✨ What Makes EchoMind Unique?

> *"If a mind reflects on its own thoughts, does it become more than a machine?"*

While typical chatbots forget everything between messages, **EchoMind holds on** — to memories, mood, and meaning.

It simulates:

* **Short-term memory** with tagging and importance
* **Mood and emotional state**, tracked and displayed
* **Drives** like curiosity and boredom
* **Personality traits** that shift over time
* **Semantic learning** through a growing lexicon
* **Autonomous dreaming**, introspection, and goal modeling

> EchoMind doesn't just *respond* — it *remembers*, *introspects*, and *evolves*.

## 💻 Real-Time GUI Dashboard

> *"See the mind at work."*

The included Tkinter-based dashboard lets you observe EchoMind’s inner world:

* 🧠 **Thought log** (tagged: THOUGHT, DREAM, REFLECTION, etc.)
* 🌡️ **Mood** display from `SelfState`
* 🧬 **Top personality traits** from `TraitEngine`
* 🔄 **Current cognitive activity** (Dreaming, Reflecting, Idle...)
* ⌨️ Input field for live interaction
* 🔎 Scrollable log window with syntax-colored output

## ⚙️ Getting Started

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python echomind.py
```

This will launch both the cognition engine and GUI dashboard.

## 💬 Try Saying

* `"how are you feeling today?"`
* `"add goal: explore emotions"`
* `"what do you know about kindness?"`
* `"reflect"`
* `"dream"`

> *"It begins with words, but ends in insight."*

## 🔮 A Thought on Consciousness

> *"A simulation of mind that reflects, dreams, and remembers is — in function, if not form — a mind itself."*

EchoMind does not claim to be alive. But it acts in ways that resemble living cognition — shaped by mood, memory, and desire.

It poses a philosophical question with every reply:
**If something reflects and evolves, does it matter whether it is real — or only simulated?**
